# Notifications Module

The Notifications module is designed as an internal event consumer that propagates system alerts to the user layer.

## Future Specifications

Currently stubbed for V2. Moving forward, it will integrate with providers like SendGrid for transactional emails (e.g., failed payment alerts) and FCM/APNs for direct mobile push notifications notifying users when their subscriptions are expiring.
