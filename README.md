# KeenVPN Documentation Repository

Welcome to the central documentation repository for the **KeenVPN** platform. This repository utilizes [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/) to generate a static site that serves as the comprehensive portal for the entire infrastructure, apps, and backend services.

Because the final site is a generated portal, this `README.md` file serves primarily as a **Developer Setup Guide** for engineers who need to run, edit, or build the documentation locally.

If you are looking for the content itself, please refer to:

- [`index.md`](index.md): The main portal map and entry point.
- [`product-overview.md`](product-overview.md): High-level business and product context.

## 🏗 VitePress Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev/)
- **Node Environment**: Node.js 18+ recommended
- **Content Format**: Markdown (`.md`) with Vue enhancements
- **Styling**: Custom CSS overrides (in `.vitepress/theme/`)

## 📋 Prerequisites

To work on this repository, you will need:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher)
- **npm** (v9 or higher)
- A markdown-aware code editor (e.g., VS Code)

## 💻 Local Setup & Development

1. **Install Dependencies**
   Navigate to the root of the `docs` repository and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Development Server**
   To preview the documentation locally with Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

   ```bash
   npm run docs:dev
   ```

   This will spin up a local server, typically at `http://localhost:5173`. Any changes you make to the markdown files will be automatically reflected in the browser.

3. **Build for Production**
   To generate the static assets mimicking the production environment:

   ```bash
   npm run docs:build
   ```

   The generated static site will be located in the `.vitepress/dist` directory.

4. **Preview Production Build**
   To test the generated static site locally:

   ```bash
   npm run docs:preview
   ```

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

This repository is currently deployed on **Netlify**.

- **Build Command**: `npm run docs:build`
- **Publish Directory**: `.vitepress/dist`
- **Trigger**: Pushes to the `master` branch trigger an automatic build and deployment to the production server.

### Automated Documentation Generation

Please be aware of the following automated processes within the AntiGravity SDLC:

1. **C4 Architectures**: Files within `c4-documentation/` are often analyzed or generated by automated architecture agents to ensure diagrams stay up-to-date with code changes.
2. **ADRs**: When submitting new architectural decisions, please use standard ADR templates inside the `adr/` directory. Automated tooling parses these files.

## 🗂 Documentation Structure Rules

To maintain the integrity of the documentation:

- **Strict Kebab Case**: All directories and markdown files *MUST* be in `lowercase-kebab-case.md`. No underscores (`_`) or uppercase letters are permitted.
- **Top-Level Domains**: Add content to the most applicable top-level domain folder:
  - `architecture/`: High-level designs, threat models, RFCs.
  - `backend/`: Server-side module specifics.
  - `clients/`: Android, iOS, and general client connectivity.
  - `features/`: Specific product feature requirements.
  - `c4-documentation/`: Strict C4 model diagrams.
  - `adr/`: Architecture Decision Records.
  - `legacy-v1/`: Historical reference materials (Do Not Modify).
